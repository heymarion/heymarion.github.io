   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m Marion. I just created this website as a place for me to just write down random things and thoughts and ideas. I&amp;#39;m really not too sure what I&amp;#39;m going to do with this. It was a lot of fun to set up the template and layout and everything. I&amp;#39;m not really too sure. For now, here&amp;#39;s an empowering quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt; 
    “I think it&#39;s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don&#39;t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we&#39;re here. I don&#39;t have to know an answer. I don&#39;t feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.” &lt;br /&gt; -- Richard Feynman
&lt;/p&gt;
