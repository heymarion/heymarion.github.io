### Welcome!

Hi, I'm Marion. I just created this website as a place for me to just write down random things and thoughts and ideas. I'm really not too sure what I'm going to do with this. It was a lot of fun to set up the template and layout and everything. I'm not really too sure. For now, here's an empowering quote:

<p class="message"> 
	“I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.” <br /> -- Richard Feynman
