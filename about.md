Hi! I'm currently a 19 year old computer science at the University of Michigan. I spend a lot of time reading, writing, and coding my life away. I also really enjoy playing video games and running. This is just a place for me to get my thoughts down on paper, whether it's a story I'm working on or a new coding project. If you want to contact me, feel free to shoot me an email at [{{site.author.email}}](mailto:{{site.author.email}})
