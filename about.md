Hey there! I'm a 19 year old student currently studying computer science at the University of Michigan. I spend a lot of time reading, writing, and coding my life away. This is just a place for me to get my thoughts down on paper, whether it's a story I'm working on or a coding project I'm exploring. Feel free to shoot me a message if you ever have any questions!
